## Week 1 - History
- Cuneiform is writing on tablets, by creating wedges shaped into them
- There were lots of different writing systems, for example Egyptians and Romans had their own systems
- The printing press was established. Writing started with the use of woodblock printing and eventually getting to the use of typewriters
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Punch cards were essential representing binary where a state of being punched or unpunched was similar to being 1 or 0
- the "bit" is the tiniest piece of information in communication
- 1 bit is of limited use so we group bits into "bytes", commonly use bytes of 8 bits
- Short term memory is used for immediate tasks and is volatile - data is lost when power is off. ex. RAM
- Long term memory is used for storing data permanently and is non-volatile - data persists without power. ex. SD cards, HDDs, SSDs
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) - Standardized way of writing letters ex. A = 65, B = 66, ...
## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Modern text structure basics include lines, whitespace, indentation and paragraphs
- Non-alphanumeric characters include characters that are not letters (a-z, A-Z) or numbers (0-9). Ex. ., -, (), []
- Markup languages originated from where editors would "mark up" manuscripts with symbols, then this got adapted to computers
- Markdown is a markup language designed for easy reading and writing in plain text
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most common markup language for web pages
- To escape special characters it is common practice to use a backslash \
## Week 4 - Manipulating Text & Text Editors
- Keyboards and mice are our primary interface to convey thoughts to the computer
- Most common layout is the QWERTY layout
- Shortcuts help with speed. Ex. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V
- Touch typing is typing without looking at the keys, important for productivity and speed
- Text editors are convenient for documents intended for human reading/printing. Ex. Microsoft Word
## Week 5 - Command Line Interface (CLI)
- In early days CLI was the only way to interact with computers
- Anatomy of modern CLIs include: promp, command, response/output and cursor
- CLI is used for its speed, precise control, automation, remote work and low resource usage
- SSH (secure Shell) is the primary tool for connecting to remote computers over a network. It is secure
